### MCP Server and Local files
In this section we will access local file "notes.txt" using these 2 tools: add_note_to_file (write), and read_notes (read)
1. python file used: local.py
2. As always, you can first test these tools using <b>MCP Inspector</b> by running `mcp dev weather.py`. after web app lauched, normally it will automatically open the webpage in browser on this address http://localhost:6274. Click Connect on the left side of the web page. Click on 'Tool' tab, click on List Tools, and test the add_note_to_file by adding content like "My favorite Genshin Impact Character is Lauma"
3. You can install it to <b>Claude Desktop</b> by typing `mcp install local.py`, check the 'claude_desktop_config.json' whether your 'LocalNotes' mcp server already there or not.
4. After installing on Claude Desktop, try it by asking the content of the local file that you have input it before. the prompt is something like this: 'Read my local notes and tell me what my favorite Genshin Impact character is'
5. To test the write to local files, you can ask anything to the claude desktop and then ask it to write, e.g. first ask: "list of top genshin impact characters based on its damage" then ask "Great - add these to my local notes"
